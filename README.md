# Differential Coverage-Directed dl framework Testing

This is an automated testing system in Python for TensorFlow and Theano powered by code coverage and differential testing.

## Getting Started

`ENV_PATH.json` stores the python path you are using in the system

It has two paths you need to configure:
* `PY_ENV_PATH`: the path of the python environment you are using

* `SITE_PATH`: the path of the site-packages you will call when you are using the python environment

<br/>

After configuring the paths, you can open `system_demo.ipynb` to run our system
